CoreShare Tech — Static Dashboard

Open the site by opening `html/index.html` in a browser. The project is a static prototype demonstrating a dashboard layout inspired by the provided mock.

Files:
- `html/index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/script.js` — small interactivity (menu toggle, card selection)

Responsive behavior:
- On small screens the left sidebar becomes a slide-in drawer (open with the ☰ menu).
- Clicking a card opens a right-hand detail drawer; tap outside or press the ✕ to close.

No build step required; just open `html/index.html` in your browser.
